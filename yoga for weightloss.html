    <p><h2>How often should you do yoga to lose weight?</h2>
        Practice yoga as often as possible in order to lose weight. You can do a more active, 
        intense practice at least 3 to 5 times per week for at least 1 hour.
        On the other days, balance out your practice with a more relaxing, gentle class.
        Hatha, yin, and restorative yoga classes are great options.
        If you’re a beginner, start slowly — start with a 20-minute practice and build up from there. 
        This allows you to build strength and flexibility and prevent injuries. Allow yourself 1 full day of
        rest each week. Combine your yoga practice with activities such as walking, cycling, or swimming for 
        added cardiovascular benefits.As part of your routine, avoid weighing yourself directly after a yoga
        class, especially hot yoga, since you may lose water weight during the class. Instead, weigh yourself 
        at the same time each day.</p>
